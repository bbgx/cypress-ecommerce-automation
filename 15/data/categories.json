It was caused by an unhandled promise rejection.\n\n  > Cypress detected that you returned a promise from a command while also invoking one or more cy commands in that promise.\n\nThe command that returned the promise was:\n\n  > `cy.click()`\n\nThe cy command you invoked inside the promise was:\n\n  > `cy.getByDataTest()`\n\nBecause Cypress commands are already promise-like, you don't need to wrap them or return your own promise.\n\nCypress will resolve your command with whatever the final Cypress command yields.\n\nThe reason this is an error instead of a warning is because Cypress internally queues commands serially whereas Promises execute as soon as they are invoked. Attempting to reconcile this would prevent Cypress from ever resolving.\n\nWhen Cypress detects uncaught errors originating from your test code it will automatically fail the current test.\n\nhttps://on.cypress.io/returning-promise-and-commands-in-another-command","children":[{"name":"Checkout two items and check if the total sum of the price matches.","uid":"88a647f0800d3056","parentUid":"85a51a9d7736b1b1d13cb3beced6e63f","status":"broken","time":{"start":1728348456280,"stop":1728348457623,"duration":1343},"flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":1,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[],"tags":[]}],"uid":"85a51a9d7736b1b1d13cb3beced6e63f"}],"uid":"bdbf199525818fae7a8651db9eafe741"},{"name":"Product defects","children":[{"name":"Timed out retrying after 4000ms: Expected to find element: `[data-test=undefined]`, but never found it.","children":[{"name":"Assert if \"Add to cart\" button inside product page is working correctly.","uid":"d48179e3af730348","parentUid":"8b1ebcc39b5c15b7a86e828185a38f26","status":"failed","time":{"start":1728348502469,"stop":1728348507472,"duration":5003},"flaky":false,"newFailed":true,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":1,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[],"tags":[]},{"name":"Assert if \"Remove\" button inside product page removes the added item from shopping cart.","uid":"776618891f09445c","parentUid":"8b1ebcc39b5c15b7a86e828185a38f26","status":"failed","time":{"start":1728348507553,"stop":1728348512569,"duration":5016},"flaky":false,"newFailed":true,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":1,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[],"tags":[]}],"uid":"8b1ebcc39b5c15b7a86e828185a38f26"}],"uid":"8fb3a91ba5aaf9de24cc8a92edc82b5d"}],"name":"categories"}
